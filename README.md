## AI-Powered Music Generation System
This project demonstrates how to create an AI-powered music generation system using deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The system can compose original music sequences based on MIDI datasets.

# Features
Converts MIDI files into sequences for training.
Implements an LSTM-based neural network for music generation.
Generates new MIDI compositions from trained models.
Uses the Music21 library for MIDI file handling and music analysis.
Supports playback and visualization of generated compositions.

Download MIDI Dataset
Place your MIDI dataset files in the dataset/ folder. You can use publicly available datasets like MAESTRO or Lakh MIDI Dataset.

# Run the Code
Use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to execute the project steps.

# Usage
1. Preprocess MIDI Files
Run the script to process MIDI files and extract note sequences:

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/preprocess_midi.py
2. Train the Model
Train the LSTM model with the preprocessed sequences:

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/train_model.py
3. Generate Music
Use the trained model to generate a new music sequence:

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/generate_music.py
4. Convert Notes to MIDI
Convert the generated sequence into a playable MIDI file:

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/convert_to_midi.py
The generated MIDI files will be saved in the output/ folder.

# Dependencies
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.0+
Music21
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Install dependencies with:

bash
